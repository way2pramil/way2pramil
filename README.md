## Hi, I'm Pramil 👋

**60% PCB designer** · **40% tool builder**
I spend most of my time designing boards — which is why I build tools on the side.  
When you hit the same pain point for the 100th time, you either complain or you fix it.

---

**11+ years** turning napkin sketches into production boards  
**68+ clients** who trusted me with their hardware  
**4000+ hours** of "let me fix that for you"  
**100% job success** on Upwork (Top-Rated Plus)

### What I actually build as PCB designer who believes hardware should just work.

🔋 **BMS systems** — that keep batteries happy (and safe)  <br>
⚡ **Motor Controllers** — that don't catch fire under load <br>
📡 **IoT Devices** — that sleep at <10µA and wake up 2 years later still working <br>
🔌 **Wireless Chargers** — Qi charging for Apple devices, packed tighter than I’d like to admit <br>
🤖 **Robotics** — Power distribution boards with fault protection  <br>
🔧 **Industrial Controller/sensors** — that work in places I'd never want to visit <br>

### The journey so far

Started as an **Assistant Professor** teaching electrical engineering — turns out I learn better by building than by lecturing.

Did a **Chief Minister Fellowship** where I automated a water treatment plant for the Government of Maharashtra. Learned that deadlines in government are... flexible. 

Now I'm a **Top-Rated Plus freelancer** on Upwork with 100% job success. Not because I'm perfect, but because I don't sleep until the design works.

### Tools I actually use (not just list on my resume)

`Altium Designer` `KiCad` `EasyEDA` `LTspice` 

### I choose technology based on constraints, not trends. <br>

`STM32` `ESP32` `nRF52` `4G LTE` `BLE` `LoRa` 

### What I'm building now


- 🔭 **[KiNotes](https://github.com/way2pramil/KiNotes)** — Open-source, Local First Smart Notes live inside KiCad (Because I kept losing my design decisions in random text files.)
- 🧰 **[PCBtools.xyz](https://pcbtools.xyz)** —  PCB resource hub (because the ecosystem is chaos) for hardware engineers who are tired of clunky workflows
- 🚀 More tools coming — built by someone who actually has to use them
- 🌱 I'm currently learning **AI-assisted design workflows** and building tools and missing links on PCBtools.xyz
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on **open-source plugins** and **hardware engineering tools**
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with  **new features to add inside KiNotes** , **spreading the word about KiNotes** to the KiCad community
- 💬 Ask me about **PCB design, BOM optimization, ultra-low power IoT, motor controllers, or why your design costs too much** — or why I debug the human circuit the same way I debug boards (root cause first, patches later)
- 📫 How to reach me: **pramil.wakchaure@gmail.com** | [pcbtools.xyz](https://pcbtools.xyz) | [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/pramil)
- ⚡ Fun fact: **I route differential pairs for relaxation. Yes, I know that's weird.** &&& - **KiNotes exists because I lost the same design note three times in one week.**

### Beyond the workbench
When I'm not staring at copper pours, you'll find me being a dad, husband, son, brother, and uncle — the circuits 👨‍👩‍👧 that actually keep me running. The roles that don't fit on a resume but matter most.
- 📚 Reading philosophy (the ancient wisdom that makes you question everything)
- 🌿 Bridging Ayurveda & modern medicine (debugging the human circuit) — same circuit, different debug tools
- ☕ Drinking too much chai
- 🧭 Care deeply about building things that last — not just electrically, but socially and ethically too

### Let's talk

If you're building something interesting — or just want to argue about via stitching — reach out.
