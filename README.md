# Hi, I'm Pramil 👋

**PCB designer who believes hardware should just work.**

11+ years of turning napkin sketches into production-ready boards. 68+ happy clients. 4000+ hours of "let me fix that for you."

### What I actually build

🔋 **BMS systems** — that keep batteries happy (and safe)  
⚡ **Motor Controllers** — that don't catch fire under load
📡 **IoT Devices** — that sleep at <10µA and wake up 2 years later still working
🔌 **Wireless Chargers** — Qi charging for Apple devices, tight component placement  
🤖 **Robotics** — Power distribution boards with fault protection  
🔧 **Industrial sensors** — that work in places I'd never want to visit

### The journey so far

Started as an **Assistant Professor** teaching electrical engineering — turns out I learn better by building than by lecturing.

Did a **Chief Minister Fellowship** where I automated a water treatment plant for the Government of Maharashtra. Learned that deadlines in government are... flexible. 

Now I'm a **Top-Rated Plus freelancer** on Upwork with 100% job success. Not because I'm perfect, but because I don't sleep until the design works.

### Tools I actually use (not just list on my resume)

`Altium Designer` `KiCad` `EasyEDA` `LTspice` 

`STM32` `ESP32` `nRF52` `4G LTE` `BLE` `LoRa`

### What I'm building now

**[PCBtools.xyz](https://pcbtools.xyz)** — Open-source tools for hardware engineers who are tired of clunky workflows.

**KiNotes** — Engineering notes that live inside KiCad. Because I kept losing my design decisions in random text files.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on **KiNotes** — engineering notes that live inside KiCad
- 🌱 I'm currently learning **AI-assisted hardware design workflows** and building tools at PCBtools.xyz
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on **open-source KiCad plugins** and **hardware engineering tools**
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with **spreading the word about KiNotes** to the KiCad community
- 💬 Ask me about **PCB design, BOM optimization, ultra-low power IoT, motor controllers, or why your design costs too much**
- 📫 How to reach me: **pramil.wakchaure@gmail.com** | [pcbtools.xyz](https://pcbtools.xyz) | [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/pramil)
- ⚡ Fun fact: **I once automated a water treatment plant for the Government of Maharashtra during a Chief Minister Fellowship. Learned that government deadlines are... flexible.**

### Beyond the workbench

When I'm not staring at copper pours, you'll find me:
- 📚 Reading philosophy (the ancient kind that makes you question everything)
- 🌿 Exploring Ayurveda (debugging the human body)
- ☕ Drinking too much chai
